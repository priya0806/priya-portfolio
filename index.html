        <p class="lead">
            As a software developer with 5+ years of experience building scalable, data-driven systems across Salesforce, Java, and cloud environments, I’m passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems. 
            I specialize in designing end-to-end CRM solutions, backend logic, and automation that improve efficiency, system performance, and user engagement for global teams. I’ve delivered projects across Sales Cloud, 
            Service Cloud, Experience Cloud, and custom integrations ranging from Apex and Lightning Web Components (LWC) to CI/CD pipelines and REST API-based middleware.
            I am currently a Software Engineer at Techvy Corp, where I design and deliver tailored technical solutions which support thousands of users, improve operational workflows, and streamline internal processes for global teams.
